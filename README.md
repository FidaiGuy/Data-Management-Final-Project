# Data-Management-Final-Project

This is my final project for my Data Wrangling and Data Management Class in R. 

In Part One, I demonstrated connecting to an API for data and creating an interactive map of microbreweries around the country. (Note: The Leaflet Package is not working on git)
In Part Two, I scraped a table from Wikipedia, cleaned the table, and utilized the ggplot2 package.

I'm sorry the files uploaded twice. I'm still getting the hang of using github and I accidentally uploaded the files twice. 

I welcome all Feedback including recomendations on what I need to work on.
